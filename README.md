### TODO

1. Split vault into "funds" so we dont reinvest what has been withdrawn after 100 days. 
2. Figure out how to map the vault-stakers' return to the vault returns. Do the thing where we swap the assets to give them back in the form they want.
3. Allow asset prices to fluctuate, thus requiring ILP.
